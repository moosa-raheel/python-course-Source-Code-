# Variables 

# Variable are like container or box where you can hold values 

# name = "Moosa"
# print(name)

# number = "6"
# print(type(number))
# a = 12 #12
# b = 6 #6
# c = a+b #12+6
# print(c)

# Why Python known as dynamic programming language

# name = "Moosa"
# print(type(name))
# name = 12
# print(type(name))

# name = "Moosa Raheel"
# age = 6

# my name is myname my age is myage
# print("my name is ",name,"my age is",age)

        # variable nameing rules 


# 1) can't start with number but you can use number in the middle or the end
# 2) Can't contain spaces
# 3) can't start with special charector or can't use special charector in the middle or the end except underscore(_)

# age1 = 18
# myage = 65
# name = 'Moosa'

# Convention 
# 1) Python recommend us snake case convention
my_age =55
